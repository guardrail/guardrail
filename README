guardrail (written in lower case) is, by now, essentially a fork of
EFF's great HTTPS everywhere. We thank the EFF for all effort they've
done in building this software - but, unfortunately - development
appears to got stuck.

guardrail aims to implement everything HTTPS Everywhere did, but in the
mid term the goals are as following (not in that exact order):

- Implement rule loading apart from the .xpi package, just like e.g.
  AdBlock Plus does. Currently, Firefox has to be restarted for every
  rule update to get the new .xpi loaded. For maintainance reasons we
  may also split off the the rules into a separate .xpi.

- Provide information about certificates. As you are reading this either
  on github or via a cloned repository currently you may be geek enough
  to figure out it's hard to convince your parents to install, say,
  CACert's root certificate. guardrail should provide an easy way to
  display more information about an issuer's certificate, whether it's
  installed or not.

- Imitate SSL Patrol. SSL Patrol is a very neat Firefox extension that
  informs you of changes in SSL certificates. However, sites as Google
  tend to randomly deliver different SSL certificates for no obvious
  reason. guardrail could add such hints into its rules to make your
  mother not be afraid when using SSL.

- Disable sending of Referer: headers when displaying mixed contents,
  e.g. on Wikipedia.

- Probably a whole lot more.

An automatically build XPI is available here:

;-) or just talk to us (tommie or yath) on IRCNet.

We're awaiting your comments, sugesstions, brainstorming and - of
course! - your pull requests!
